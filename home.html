                    <p>Our first date at Mooboo Bubble Tea in Cardiff. Sofia made Liam walk around Cardiff and he frequently complains this was annoying. They settled on a bench in Alexandra Gardens to talk and Sofia breathed a sigh of relief when during their conversation, she found out Liam did not harbour any extreme right-wing views that would make dating a brown girl from Easton near impossible. She found him really interesting. They discussed tattoos, politics, and their family - not knowing they would one day become each others'.</p>

                    <p>Sofia had planned a romantic evening together. First, a meal at the Butcher's Arms which provided a quality meal for the hungry pair. After the meal, they set off to the Brecon Observatory. Unfortunately, they got lost and were awaiting a response from the activity coordinator. The activity coordinator returned saying the weather was too snowy for the activity to go ahead. However, Sofia saw a moment on the side of the road to talk about the Engagement Ring Asterism. The couple had been looking at engagement rings prior to this. Sofia had a speech written up. One where she had to include a some words about letting her ramble as Liam did in fact try to interrupt. He said yes in the car and they returned home for nosecco and berries, letting friends and family know about the news.</p>
